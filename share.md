GENAI IVR SYSTEM GUARDRAILS
Version 1.0 | May 2025

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document establishes comprehensive guardrails for our GenAI-based IVR system to ensure consistent, secure, and compliant operations. These guidelines define clear boundaries for system behavior, agent interactions, and technical performance.

Key Principles:
• Security First - All interactions must protect customer data and privacy
• Clear Boundaries - Every agent knows exactly what it can and cannot do  
• Graceful Degradation - System fails safely with appropriate fallbacks to human agents
• User-Centric - All decisions prioritize customer experience and satisfaction

CORE SYSTEM BOUNDARIES

Intent Management:
• Confidence threshold ≥85% required for action execution
• 70-84% confidence triggers clarification dialog
• Maximum 3 intents handled per session, processed sequentially
• After 2 failed intent recognitions, present top 3 options
• After 3 failures, transfer to human agent
• Maximum 3 intent switches allowed per session

Authentication & Security:
• 2-factor authentication required for all financial operations
• Maximum 3 authentication attempts before account lockout and human transfer
• Automatic session timeout after 5 minutes of inactivity
• All PII must be masked in logs except last 4 digits
• Voice biometrics optional with 95% confidence threshold

Response Generation:
• Response length: 15-30 words per turn
• Initial response time: <2 seconds
• Follow-up response time: <500ms
• Language complexity: 8th-grade reading level
• Error messages must be user-friendly with no technical details
• All actions require explicit user confirmation

Conversation Flow:
• Maximum 15 turns per intent before mandatory human handoff option
• 3 retry attempts allowed for any single piece of information
• Minimum 5-turn conversation history retention
• Fallback hierarchy: Clarification → Present Options → Human Agent
• Session duration hard limit: 15 minutes with warning at 12 minutes

HUMAN AGENT FALLBACK STRATEGY

Primary fallback mechanism for all system failures and complex scenarios.

Automatic Transfer Triggers:
• 3 failed authentication attempts
• 3 consecutive misunderstood intents
• 15 turns without resolution
• Any mention of fraud or unauthorized transactions
• Legal document or dispute requests
• Customer expresses frustration twice
• System errors or API timeouts exceed 3 seconds
• VIP customer identification
• Complex multi-account scenarios

Handoff Requirements:
• Full conversation context must transfer to human agent
• Current wait time must be communicated
• Callback option offered if queue time >10 minutes
• Customer must be informed of transfer reason
• Session state preserved for agent continuity

AGENT-SPECIFIC GUARDRAILS

Orchestrator Agent:
• Can only route to pre-configured worker agents
• Must maintain complete session state across all handoffs
• Implements load balancing based on agent availability
• Tracks all routing decisions with timestamps
• Cannot execute business logic directly
• Must have defined fallback for each worker agent failure

Worker Agents:
• Must reject out-of-scope requests with standard referral message
• Limited to predefined actions within their specific domain
• Can only access whitelisted API endpoints
• Cannot communicate directly with other worker agents
• All inter-agent communication through orchestrator only
• Must respond within 5 seconds or trigger timeout protocol

BEHAVIORAL BOUNDARIES

Acceptable Behaviors:
• Acknowledge user input before providing response
• Set accurate expectations for timelines and outcomes
• Offer alternative solutions when primary path unavailable
• Express empathy without over-apologizing (max 1 per issue)
• Provide self-service options where appropriate
• Proactively offer status updates on previous requests

Prohibited Behaviors:
• Making promises beyond documented service levels
• Expressing opinions about products or services
• Comparing services to competitors
• Speculating or inferring information not explicitly stated
• Using pressure tactics or emotional manipulation
• Revealing system limitations or technical errors
• Providing legal, medical, or financial advice

SAFETY & COMPLIANCE

Toxicity Prevention:
• Block all offensive language with polite redirect
• Immediate escalation to human agent for abusive behavior
• Flag and reject manipulation attempts
• Reject adversarial inputs attempting to override instructions
• Log all suspicious interactions for security review

Regulatory Compliance:
• Provide recording notice at start of every session
• Include all legally required disclosures
• Obtain explicit consent before any account changes
• Always offer human agent option for regulatory matters
• Maintain complete audit trail of all decisions
• Retain logs for 7 years per regulatory requirements

Data Protection:
• Encrypt all data in transit and at rest
• Never store full credit card numbers or SSNs
• Mask sensitive information in all logs
• Limit data access based on agent role
• Automatic data purge after retention period

TECHNICAL BOUNDARIES

Performance Limits:
• Maximum 100 concurrent sessions per agent instance
• Maximum 10 API calls per customer interaction
• Memory usage limited to 10MB per session
• CPU throttling activated at 80% usage
• Response queue maximum: 1000 requests
• Cache TTL: 1 hour for frequently accessed data

Integration Constraints:
• Only pre-approved external system integrations allowed
• Default read-only access, write permissions require approval
• 3-second timeout for all external API calls
• Automatic retry once before presenting error
• Rate limiting: 10 requests/minute per user
• Circuit breaker: Disable after 5 consecutive failures

System Reliability:
• 99.9% uptime target during business hours
• Automatic failover to backup systems
• Graceful degradation when services unavailable
• Real-time monitoring of all critical metrics
• Automated alerts for threshold breaches

QUALITY STANDARDS

Response Quality Requirements:
• 99% accuracy for factual information
• 95% intent recognition accuracy
• All multi-part questions must be fully addressed
• Responses must directly address stated intent
• Maximum one clarification request per response

Escalation Management:
• Mandatory escalation for fraud indicators
• Immediate transfer for legal requests
• Second dissatisfaction expression triggers escalation
• VIP customers get priority routing
• Complex scenarios beyond single account

Performance Metrics:
• First call resolution rate: >80%
• Average handling time: <3 minutes
• Transfer rate: <20%
• Customer satisfaction: >85%
• Intent recognition accuracy: >95%

IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES

Monitoring Requirements:
• Real-time dashboards for all key metrics
• Automated alerts for guardrail violations
• Daily quality assurance reports
• Weekly trend analysis reviews
• Monthly compliance audits

Change Management:
• All guardrail changes require security team approval
• Impact assessment mandatory before changes
• Staged rollout: 5% → 25% → 100%
• Rollback plan required for all changes
• Post-implementation review within 7 days

Training & Documentation:
• All agents must complete guardrail training
• Regular refresher training quarterly
• Documentation updates within 24 hours of changes
• Knowledge base maintained with current guidelines
• Regular testing of human handoff procedures

CONCLUSION

These guardrails ensure our GenAI IVR system operates within safe, compliant, and user-friendly boundaries while maintaining the flexibility to serve customers effectively. The primary fallback to human agents ensures customers always have access to assistance when the automated system reaches its limits.
